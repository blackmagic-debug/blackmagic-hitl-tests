Welcome to the Black Magic HITL Test repository.

HITL stands for Hardware In The Loop.

Here we collect scripts and tools used for the Continuous Integration tests of the Black Magic Probe hardware and software that involves real host and target hardware.

We are also collecting here lists of evaluation hardware that the core developers of Black Magic have access to. It will hopefully be useful to determine who should be able to reproduce and debug certain issues with the Black Magic Probe.

Some of the developers also accept development board donations to improve our coverage.
